### Psychic-Game

The Psychic-Game is a game utilizing simple HTML, to display the text and information, and some JavaScript code, to detect the user's input and react accordingly.

This project is useful because it allows students a hands-on approach to incorporate concepts learned in class lectures and activities.

### Instructions

* Single player game; player attempts to guess the randomly generated letter of the computer's choosing.

**Rules for Psychic-Game**

Player chooses letter from alphabet (a-z).
Player receives 9 tries before exhausting given guesses.
If Player's letter choice matches the Computer correctly, Player wins the game.
If Player exhausts 9 guesses, Player loses the game.

**NOTE:** A `for-loop` is not technically necessary to make Psychic-Game game, but could be used. Focus on the topics we have just covered when thinking about how to build out the game.

* **NOTE:** Donâ€™t use `document.write` as it will delete the contents of your page including your JavaScript. Use  `document.getElementById`, alongside `innerHTML`, to write to the DOM.
